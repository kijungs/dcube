D-Cube: Dense-Block Detection in Terabyte-Scale Tensors
========================
**D-Cube (Disk-based Dense-block Detection)** is an algorithm for detecting dense subtensors in tensors.
**D-Cube** has the following properties:
 * *scalable*: **D-Cube** handles large data not fitting in memory or even on a disk.
 * *fast*: Even when data fit in memory, **D-Cube** outperforms its competitors in terms of speed.
 * *accurate*: **D-Cube** gives high accuracy in real-world data as well as theoretical accuracy guarantees.
