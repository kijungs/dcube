D-Cube (Disk-based Dense-block Detection) is an algorithm for detecting dense subtensors in web-scale tensors. 
D-Cube has the following properties:
 - Scalable: D-Cube can handle large data not fitting in memory or even on a disk.
 - Fast: Even when data fit in memory, D-Cube outperforms its competitors in terms of speed.
 - Accurate: D-Cube detects dense subtensors in real-world tensors accurately, providing theoretical
accuracy guarantees.
